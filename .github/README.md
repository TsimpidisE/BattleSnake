# System Documentation 
# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this system documentation is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Battlesnake AI system. It includes information about the system's architecture, code structure, setup, usage, testing, deployment, monitoring, security, and documentation.

## 1.2 Scope
This documentation is intended for developers, system administrators, and anyone involved in the deployment, maintenance, or enhancement of the Battlesnake AI system.

## 1.3 System Overview
The Battlesnake AI system is designed to control the behavior of a snake in the Battlesnake game. The system prevents the snake from moving backward, avoids collisions with walls, itself, and other snakes, and aims to consume food to survive and win the game.

# 2. System Architecture
## 2.1 High-Level Architecture
The system follows a modular architecture with components for game logic, movement strategies, and server setup. It communicates with the Battlesnake game server using HTTP requests.

## 2.2 Components
Game Logic: Contains functions for game initialization, handling the start and end of a game, and determining the next move based on the game state.
Movement Strategies: Includes algorithms for preventing collisions with walls, itself, and other snakes, as well as seeking out and consuming food.
Server Setup: Configures the server to respond to Battlesnake game events and requests.
## 2.3 Data Flow
The data flow starts with receiving game events from the Battlesnake server. The system processes these events, executes the game logic, and determines the next move for the Battlesnake. The chosen move is then sent back to the Battlesnake server.

# 3. Code Structure
## 3.1 File Overview
The code is organized in a single file, server.js, which contains functions for game initialization, start and end events, and determining the next move.

## 3.2 Key Functions
info(): Provides information about the Battlesnake, including the author, color, head, and tail.

start(gameState): Handles the start of a game.

end(gameState): Handles the end of a game.

move(gameState): Determines the next move based on the game state.

## 3.3 Dependencies
